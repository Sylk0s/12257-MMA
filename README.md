# 12259-MMA

Project for MAA question 12257 to find pairs of Heron Triangles from the file triangles.txt with the same perimeter and area.
Will be modified later to address the idea of supplementary pairs.
Currently generates a medium sized list in the output.txt file.

Now also generates lists with the same area AND perimeter!
